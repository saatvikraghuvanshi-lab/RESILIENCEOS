Resilience-OS is a unified, predictive, and civilian-centric disaster management ecosystem. It replaces fragmented, reactive legacy systems with a single, real-time "Source of Truth" for national emergency services, responders, and the public.

⚡ The Problem
India's disaster response currently faces a Readiness Gap:
Fragmentation: Agencies work in silos without shared visibility.
Latency: The "Golden Hour" is lost to manual coordination.
Network Fragility: Traditional systems fail when cellular towers go down.
Reactive Bias: Systems track what happened, not what will happen.

🚀 The Solution: Resilience-OS
Our platform operates across three critical layers:
1. Strategic Command (Admin)
Resilience Matrix: A live scoring engine that calculates infrastructure strain using population density and hazard intensity.
Dynamic Resource Allocation: One-click dispatch for NDRF Units, Maritime Rescue, and Medical Teams.

Temporal Simulations: A "Flood T+0H" slider to visualize disaster progression and preemptively clear evacuation routes.

2. Tactical Response (Responders)
Offline Mesh Uplink: A peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol allowing responders to sync data without cellular service.
Real-Time GPS Tracking: Precise asset location mapping for specialized forces (Alpha-7, Rescue Boat 2).

3. Public Safety (Civilian)
SOS Terminal: High-priority distress signals with automated location locking.
Resilience Academy: Gamified readiness training and "Go-Bag" checklists to ensure civilian preparedness before a crisis strikes.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.  
Maps & Geo: Mapbox GL JS for live tactical overlays and resource mapping.  
Backend & Auth: Vercel (Deployment), Supabase (Real-time WebSockets & Database), Clerk/Supabase Auth (RBAC).  
Resilience: Offline-first PWA design and simulated WebRTC P2P Mesh Networking for low-connectivity environments.  
Intelligence: AI-driven prediction engine for risk assessment and "Resilience Index" calculation.
